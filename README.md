# Portfolio (Built Using Next.js)

# Overview:

This project is a personal portfolio website aimed at showcasing your professional journey, including skills, certifications, projects, and experiences.
Built using Next.js, it delivers excellent performance, SEO capabilities, and a seamless user experience.
Technologies Used:

# Framework:

Developed using Next.js, a React framework that offers server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). These features improve both the website’s performance and its visibility in search engines.

# Styling:

Designed using CSS modules, ensuring modular and scoped styles for cleaner and reusable code.
Incorporated modern CSS techniques to achieve responsiveness and visual appeal across all device sizes.

# Image Handling:

Initially used Firebase for storing and retrieving images, but encountered issues where images did not display properly after page refresh.
Resolved this by switching to Amazon S3 for reliable image hosting and explored Next.js’s unoptimized image configuration for further troubleshooting.
